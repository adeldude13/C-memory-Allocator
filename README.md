# Memory Allocator
i know it aint much but i learned alot about computer memory writing this, so it was worth it 
## Compiling and Running
* note: this is only tested on linux(Arch BTW) im not sure about other platforms.
* another note: the make file is using -O0 and -ggdb3 flags
* to compile the Code simply type
```bash
$ make
```
